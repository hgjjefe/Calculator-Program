Calculator Program I made during the Christmas and New Year break because I have no life.

The calculator is in normal mode by default, where you can enter expressions normally, but you can also press the FMLA button and input a formula number to enter formula mode. 
In formula mode, you enter the arguments separated by commas and press enter, and it will show the outputs of that chosen formula.
For the input/output information of the formulas, please refer to the comments of the js course code.

Also, the AlPHA button toggles small text.
